As you may have noticed, I have replaced the theme and reorganized the site.
You may or may not have also noticed that I moved my (Daniel F. Dickinson's)
'About' page and technical blog off this site.

<!--more-->

They have been moved to [Daniel F. Dickinson's professional
website](https://www.danielfdickinson.ca/), along with pruning some pages.

[On my personal (yet another) blog I describe some reasons for the redesign and
pruning](https://www.princesandmadmen.ca/blog/site-redesign-and-pruning-feb-2023/).

Oh, and in many places I have replaced _Wild Tech "Garden"_ with _Wild Tech
'Garden'_. This is because too much of the backend of the internet gets
confused by double quotes (") in titles and metadata. (Yes, despite it being
2023, failing to properly handle arbitrary user data is still a thing).
