Both this site's homes have been moved to different hosting. That is both the
code and web hosting have changed. [OVHcloud][ovhcloud] is the new CDN and web
host and [GitHub][github] stores the source code.

This is part of a long-term consolidation of 'our' hosting. In addition
[Daniel][dfd] decided that [OVHcloud][ovhcloud] is a pretty good deal and gets
the job done. Even though the standard support (that is, online only) can be
frustrating for speed, and sometimes for communication, it comes with the service
without additional fees. When it becomes financially sound to do so (or necessary
due to dependence on [OVHcloud][ovhcloud] capabilities), Wild Tech 'Garden'
will upgrade to a higher level support plan.

In the case of the source code hosting, [Wild Tech 'Garden'](/), in the
person of [Daniel F. Dickinson][dfd] decided
that [GitHub][github] was the preferred option because it is

1. where more code is hosted, and
2. it's easier to be found, and to find others, on [GitHub][github]

Since Wild Tech 'Garden' decided to spend on [GitHub][github], it didn't
make much sense to either also spend on [GitLab][gitlab], or to use the
(less capable) free tier \[of [GitLab][gitlab]].

Circling back to [OVHcloud][ovhcloud] decision for the CDN and web hosting,
it seems to [Wild Tech 'Garden'](/) that using [OVHcloud][ovhcloud] provides
better performance to relevant areas of the world. Further [Netlify][netlify]
is apparently not as good for SEO due to being blocked or blocking in various
regions. [Netlify][netlify] (and full CI pipelines) are also overkill for the
[Wild Tech 'Garden'](/) site, as well as other sites [Daniel][dfd] creates
and hosts for personal and professional use.

[Netlify][netlify] also costs more than [OVHcloud's][ovhcloud] offering
that meets [Wild Tech 'Garden's](/) needs.
