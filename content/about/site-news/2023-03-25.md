[About a month ago I replaced the theme of this site](2023-02-26.md). Over
the course of the past two weeks I have taken that a step further and
greatly enhanced the base [Zen theme for
Hugo](https://github.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen). I have named the result
the [DFD-Zen theme](https://gitlab.com/danielfdickinson/dfd-hugo-theme-zen)
(for Hugo).

It has quite a few extra features (not yet documented) and I think it looks
better. Of course the author of the Zen theme for Hugo does advise that the Zen
theme is a _base_ theme not a complete theme.

In any case, I am happy with the result, and I hope you are as well.
