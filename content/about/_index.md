A technical documentation website on a variety of topics, projects, and
presentations, currently all by [Daniel F.
Dickinson](https://www.danielfdickinson.ca/). Daniel is prone to using
'we' in documentation because he doesn't feel that 'I' has the right tone.

If you came here expecting to see a garden, you may be interested in [the
garden that inspired the name of this
site](https://www.princesandmadmen.ca/blog/garden-gallery/) (when
combined with Daniel being a 'techie').
