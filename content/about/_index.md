Among other things this is the home of Wild Tech 'Garden' (a technology
consulting business), and a technical documentation website on a variety
of topics, projects, and presentations.

[Wild Tech 'Garden'](/) is a recently registered business owned
and operated by [Daniel F. Dickinson][dfd] who is a computing technology
expert with decades of experience. [Daniel][dfd] has actively learned new
skills and technology throughout the years.

At present he is cross-skilling with the Microsoft Power Platform, as
Microsoft is the dominant (almost only) platform used by businesses in
his local area, and the time and opportunity were available for the
education and practise.

In the process [Daniel][dfd] is developing a custom application using
the Power Platform for a local non-profit. [Daniel][dfd] is also in
the process of obtaining current certifications that demonstrate his
existing general computing knowledge ([CompTIA's][comptia] A+
certification) as well as the skills he is acquiring in Power Platform
(Microsoft certifications). This is all in addition to [Daniel's][dfd]
Bachelor of Computing from the [University of Guelph][ugoo], the content
on this website, and his extensive experience in the field.

In future, it is hoped that [Wild Tech 'Garden'](/) will gain additional
members and become the local and regional preferred provider for
high-level technical needs[^1].
