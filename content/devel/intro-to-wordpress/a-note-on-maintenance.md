* I highly recommend reading the [Maintenance](https://wordpress.org/support/category/maintenance/) and [Security](https://wordpress.org/support/category/security/) section of the [WordPress Documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/).
* If there is interest we could do another session on those topics.
