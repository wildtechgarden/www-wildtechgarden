## Basic Customization

* If all you want is a very basic blog site and just want to replace the example post and page with your own content, you could use the site as is.
* If you are eager to try things out and are planning on having just a blog, or mostly a blog site, you could post now, and customize later.

1. Even in these cases, you will likely still want.
2. Select ‘Appearance|Menus’,
3. Set ‘Menu Name’ (e.g. to ‘Top Menu’), then ‘Create Menu’
4. Check ‘Sample Page’ and select ‘Add to Menu’
5. Check ‘Primary menu’ and select ‘Save Menu’.
