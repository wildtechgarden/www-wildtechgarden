* Now it is time to replace the 'Sample Page' and 'Hello World!' post with your own contents.
* Because of permalinks,the best option is to create a new page or post and then delete the old, because the page or post will have a different title and have quite different content.

1. On the front page, hover over 'New' and select 'Page'.
   {{< figure alt="Adding a new About Page" caption="Adding a new About Page" src="/assets/images/2021/01/index-32_1-png-1-1024x597.png" >}}
2. You will see 'Welcome to the block editor' which will give you brief tour of the WordPress block editor.
3. Create a title; the default permalink will be based on this title.
4. Click on 'Status & visibility' (this will hide it).
5. Click on 'Permalink'
   {{< figure alt="Page editor with Permalink visible" caption="Page editor with Permalink visible" src="/assets/images/2021/01/index-33_1-png-1.png" >}}
6. Notice 'URL slug' is currently 'about' (lower-cased and any problem characters removed).
7. You can choose a custom slug.
   * The 'slug' forms the final part of the pages URL (web address).
8. Click on 'Status & visibility' (this will make it visible again).
   {{< figure alt="Page editor with Status & visibility showing" caption="Page editor with Status & visibility showing" src="/assets/images/2021/01/index-34_1-png-1.png" >}}
   * The 'Visibility' option allows you to make a page 'Public', 'Private', or 'Password Protected'.
   * The 'Publish' option let's you change the date of publishing (past/present/future) for the purposes of your website organization. Past and present posts are immediately visible. Future posts are scheduled to be made visible (published) at a future date and time.
9. Once you are satisfied with the page make it 'live' by selecting the 'Publish' button on the top right of the page.
   {{< figure alt="Making 'About' page go live" caption="Making 'About' page go live" src="/assets/images/2021/01/index-35_1-png-1.png" >}}
10. You will then be asked to double-check visibility and date of publishing.
11. Select 'publish' to bring it to the masses.
12. You can now see the 'Page address' or select 'View page' or 'Copy Link'.
