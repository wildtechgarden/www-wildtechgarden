1. Now select ‘New|Post’
2. This looks very similar to the ‘Page’ editor, but there are more drop down options.
3. Notice for instance the ‘Post format’ which has quite a list of options. You will definitely want to view the [WordPress Documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/).
4. You will probably want to add at least one category from ‘Categories’, and add multiple tags.
   {{< figure alt="Page editor showing categories and tags" caption="Page editor showing categories and tags" src="/assets/images/2021/01/index-40_1-png-1.png" >}}
5. Categories are usually broader and may be in a tree (hierarchy).
   * The editing page as it looks with a 'Featured Image' and 'Excerpt'.
     {{< figure alt="Page editor showing 'Featured Image' and 'Excerpt'" caption="Page editor showing 'Featured Image' and 'Excerpt'" src="/assets/images/2021/01/index-40_2-png-1-1024x679.png" >}}
   * Both are optional.
   * A 'Featured Image' is highly recommended.
6. Publish it and 'View Post'.
   {{< figure alt="First Real Post after publishing" caption="First Real Post after publishing" src="/assets/images/2021/01/index-41_1-png-1-1024x895.png" >}}

You will notice the graphic is below the title but above the post.
