[Bots & Bytes 2019 was a programme created and run by a group of volunteers](https://midlandlibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/botsbytes-2019-full.pdf) for the [Midland Public Library MakerPlace](https://midlandlibrary.com/the-mpl-makerplace/). The source code for the volunteer created and operated programme's documents and programs were removed from public view and [only the final document in the official Midland Public Library MakerPlace web resources](https://midlandlibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/botsbytes-2019-full.pdf) remains due to the request of the CEO of the [Midland Public Library](https://midlandlibrary.com/), as it was deemed to not be in accordance with the policies of the MPL regarding official communications channels and the appropriate process by which a programme for the MPL is created and run. I can't say I wasn't disappointed, but it is what is. The source code is available on request.
