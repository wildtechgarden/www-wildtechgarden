I've made yet more improvements to this website, but you should check out
[a high quality site built using Hugo](https://www.veriphor.com/),
by an extremely helpful web professional. That illustrates what someone
who's career is web development can do with Hugo, rather than my
puttering with web design as aside to the the things I on which I focus
my energy.

Joe Mooring (the above-mentioned web professional), also has an excellent,
and [very professional series of articles on using
Hugo](https://www.veriphor.com/articles/). I now consider this recommended
reading for those who wish to use Hugo.

I've also ([with the help of over members the Hugo
forums](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/image-handling-module-now-has-lqip-without-needing-javascript/44141/)),
add LQIP[^1] functionality to my [image handling module for
Hugo](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/image-handling-mod-hugo-dfd) which
does not require JavaScript. It is, however, not yet documented.

[^1]: Low Quality Image Placeholder: a small and quick to load image
or colour gradient that takes the place a larger (and therefore slower
to load) image, until the full image loads.
