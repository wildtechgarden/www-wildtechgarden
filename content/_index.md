### Site News

#### Sunday, February 26, 2023

As you may have noticed, I have replaced the theme and reorganized the site.
You may or may not have also noticed that I moved my (Daniel F. Dickinson's)
'About' page, and the technical blog part of this site to [Daniel F.
Dickinson's professional website](https://www.danielfdickinson.ca/), along with
pruning some pages.

[On my personal (yet another) blog I describe some reasons for the redesign and pruning](https://www.princesandmadmen.ca/blog/site-redesign-and-pruning-feb-2023/).

Oh, and in many places I have replaced _Wild "Tech" Garden_ with _Wild 'Tech'
Garden_. This is because too much of the backend of the internet gets
confused by double quotes (") in titles and metadata. (Yes, despite it being
2023, failing to properly handle arbitrary user data is still a thing).
